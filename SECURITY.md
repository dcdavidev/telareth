# Telareth Security Policy

Telareth is built for developers, by developers. Security is not an afterthought — it’s part of the developer experience we strive to deliver.  
We believe in responsible disclosure, transparent communication, and fast, pragmatic responses to keep the ecosystem safe for everyone who builds on Telareth.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following release lines:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| Latest  | ✅ Yes    |
| Older   | ❌ No     |

In practice:

- The **latest stable release** always receives security patches.
- All other versions are considered end-of-life and will not receive updates. We recommend upgrading as soon as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, use GitHub’s [**Private Vulnerability Reporting**](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature directly on the Telareth repository.  
This ensures that only maintainers can see your report while we investigate.

If GitHub advisories aren’t an option, you may alternatively reach us at **security@telareth.dev**.

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fixes (if available)

## Response Process

- We will acknowledge valid reports within **5 business days**
- You will receive regular updates while we work on a resolution
- Once confirmed, we will:
  - Develop and test a fix
  - Publish a patched release
  - Credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask reporters to:

- Give us reasonable time to resolve the issue before public disclosure
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability while it remains unpatched

Security is a shared responsibility — thanks for helping us make Telareth safer and stronger for the entire community.
